# OCD-Patients-Data-Analysis
Exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing demographic and clinical data of 1500 OCD patients. Analysis of OCD Patients dataset by Y-BOCS Score ( Severity)


## Project Overview:

This data analysis project aims to provide insights on understanding the relationships between various demographic factors and clinical outcomes of OCD Patients. By analysing various aspects of OCD severity based on different factos.

## Data Sourse:

The Primary dataset used for this analysis is "OCD Patient Dataset_ Demographics & Clinical Data" which is a Microsoft Excel Comma Seperated Values (CVS) File provided by "Unified Mentor" for internship.

## Tools:  Excel
- Extracting Data-  Power query Editor(PQE)
- Cleaning & Transforming Data- PQE Tools - Filtering,Conditional formating
- Data Modelling - Power Pivot
- Data Analysis - Pivot Tables
- Visulizing/ Dashboard- Charts, Slicer

  ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Are there differences in OCD severity based on gender or Ethnicity? 
- Is there a correlation  between OCD types with age and Y-BOCS score?
- What are the common medications used, and how do they relate to the severity of OCD symtoms?
- Is there a correlation previous Diagnosis and OCD severity?
 
  ## Results/ Findings

  The analysis  results are summerized as follows:

  #### Gender Distribution:

   The analysis reveals that 753 of affected individuals are male, while 747 are females. This almost balanced distribution suggests that OCD does not exhibit a strong gender bias among the studied population.


  #### Ethnicity Distribution:

  Causasian individuals show the highest prevalence of OCD, with 398 patients, followed closely by Hispanic and Asian groups with 392 and 386 patients respectively. Africans appear to be the least affected ethnic group, with 324 cases.

  #### Correlation of Patient's age and Obsession type:

  Harm-related obsession are most prevalent in all age group specifically with age range of 40-60 years.
  Religious obsession is most prevalence in age range of 20-40 years.
  Patients with age below 20 years are least affected by any obsession type.

  #### Correlation of Patient's age and Compulsion type:

  In term of compulsion type washing is the most frequent in all age ranges, specifically with age range of 40-60 years, followed by counting.
  Checking compulsion is most prevalence in age  range 20-40 years.
  Patients with age range below 20 years is least affected by all compulsion types.

  #### OCD Medications:

  26% OCD patients are not getting any medication. Remaining getting different medications including-
  - Benzodiazepine 26%
  - SNRI 25%
  - SSRE 23%
 
  #### Previous Diagnosis:

  Previous Diagnosis analysis reveals 25% of OCD Patients do not have any previous Diagnosis. While most common previous Diagnosis is PTSD which is 25% followed by MDD and Panic Disorder both 17% each.

## Recommendation

Understanding the demographic and diagnostic patterns in this analysis is crucial for healthcare professionals and policymakers.
Intervention strategies should consider the observed variations in prevalence across gender, ethnicity, and age groups.

Given the prevalence of harm-related obsessions, it is recommended that intervention strategies specifically address this aspect of OCD. This may involve targeted therapeutic approaches, support groups, or educational resources to help indiduals manage and cope with these specific concerns.

Considering that the below 20 years age group showed the least prevalence of OCD, it is crucial to focus on early detection and intervention strategies for young people. Education programs, awareness campaigns and mental health screening can play a pivotal role in identifying individuals who may benefit from early intervention.

additionally, continued monitoring of yearly trends can inform resources allocation and research priorities in the field of OCD.

## Conclusion

This detailed analysis provides valuable insights into the distribution and characteristics of OCD cases, open the way for more effective approaches to diagnosis, treatment and support for individuals affected by OCD.
